2) install theano and pygpu (conda install theano pygpu)
3) numpy downgrade to 1.12 (install install numpy = 1.12)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53423610/how-to-update-scan-cython-code-in-theano

#testing
python
import theano

#after all set
#training - trains model and saves it in a file called model.npz
python ./LIG-Doctor.py ./mimic-90-10_02_271 ./model

#testing
python ./LIG-Doctor-test.py ./mimic-90-10_02_271 ./model.npz

DISCLAIMER: we built the data file using the mimic-III dataset; but the file is nothing but a bunch of numbers in binary format;
in order to make sense out of the file, one must download mimic-III from https://mimic.physionet.org
